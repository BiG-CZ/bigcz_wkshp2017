# bigcz_wshp2017

BiG-CZ/ODM2 User Workshop

## "tutorial content"

Jupyter notebooks, data files used in tutorials, other code, etc, will be hosted on the repo https://github.com/BiG-CZ/wshp2017_tutorial_content. "a repo that has the initial environment that each user will have within their jupyterhub environment"


## JupyterHub test setup

- **TO-DO:** "Do you know who has control over the http://bigcz.org domain name? I'm trying to figure out the domain for the jupyterhub. I was thinking http://jupyterhub.bigcz.org?" FOLLOW UP WITH ANTHONY.
- From Emilio to Don: will need instructions you have about how to upload notebooks, data, etc (I have some memory of the shell git clone process used in Geohackweek).
- More details, for now, at https://github.com/BiG-CZ/wshp2017_tutorial_content/issues/3
