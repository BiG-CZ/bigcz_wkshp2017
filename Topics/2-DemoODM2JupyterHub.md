Hands-on activities in Python and R will be provided a Jupyter notebooks dynamically running code in a customized, personal environment on  [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io). All required notebook files, supporting code, data files, and Conda environment files will be cloned from on a second repository:

* https://github.com/BiG-CZ/wshp2017_tutorial_content
* This repository is intended for `git` cloning into your personal JupyterHub user space or your local computer.
