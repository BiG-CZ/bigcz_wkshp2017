# More on ODM2 Controlled Vocabularies
Presenting: Anthony &  Jeff

### We created the [ODM2 Controlled Vocabularies](http://vocabulary.odm2.org/) to:

1. Facilitate Data Interoperability
  * ODM2 CVs were developed by combining the best terms from existing CVs (i.e. CUAHSI CVs, IEDA EarthChem CVs) and by developing numerous new “Types” CV lists to facilitate data integration across disciplines.
2. Enable Class-Subclass Capabilities
  * We developed new "Types" CV lists to better enable Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) between relational ODM2 databases and software written in object-oriented programing languages.


### We created the [ODM2 Controlled Vocabulary System](http://vocabulary.odm2.org/) to:

1. Enable machine-to-machine communication
  * via a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) and associated web services.
2. Enable community contributions
  * such as suggesting, editing and moderating CV terms.
